          <p> As anyone who has tried to play <a href="blockjack.io">blockjack</a> on the mainnet will tell you, fast transaction confirmations make a huge difference for dapps.  Now that this site has been up and running for a week of so, a couple of things are evident in the data that can shed light on how to speed up transaction confirmation times.  Currently, the median transaction confirmation time on the ETH network is about 38 seconds and 95% of transactions confirm within 105 seconds.  Not too shabby, but also not really good enough for maximal enjoyment of blockjack.</p>

          <p> <span class="blog_bold">1) First, let’s start with won’t help: paying really high gas prices.</span></p>  
          <p>One behavior that I was surprised to see is that a lot of people don’t seem to mind paying a lot for gas.  In contrast, only a tiny minority of users try to get a bargain on their transactions:  Less than .01% of all ETH transactions are mined with a gas price of less than 20 gwei, whereas about 5% are mined with a gas price > 40 gwei (people know how to change the default gas price- they just always make it higher rather than lower).  This tendency to pay high gas prices may arise from recent user experiences with Bitcoin where offering high transaction fees has become an unfortunate requirement for using the network.  With ETH, where blocks are not full, someone paying 15 gwei can currently expect a confirmation within 90 seconds as opposed to 40 seconds for people paying 20 gwei.  This may seem like an ok value in some cases, but the differences for people paying more than 20 gwei is less clear.  You can get a bit of value offering 40 gwei for gas (median confirmation time goes down to about 30 seconds)- but over this there is minimal gain.  For example, currently in the EGS database over the last 10,000 blocks, there are 7000 transactions that paid over 50 gwei for gas that were confirmed with an average of 31s wait time as opposed to an average of 33s for transactions that paid 40-50 gwei.  For transactions paying over 100 gwei (n=3500), the average confirmation time was 32s.  Clearly, a plateau has been reached - users can't do better by throwing money at the problem.</p>

          <p> <span class="blog_bold">2) If you can’t speed up by offering high gas price, what can be done? One change that would clearly help is getting miners to stop mining empty blocks.</span> </p><p> What’s interesting about miner behavior is not the differences in minimum price accepted but the variation in amount of empty blocks that they mine.  For example, ethfans is an absolute gem of a pool for user experience with less than 1% empty blocks mined at the 20 gwei minimum price.  In contrast, Dwarfpool, which also mines transactions with a 20 gwei minimum has a staggering 67% of their blocks empty.  Clearly something is amiss at Dwarfpool.  Probably there are some nodes that always mine empty blocks and some that mine full blocks.  Getting Dwarfpool to work out these inefficiencies could make a huge difference to user experience, as mining an empty block when users have submitted a fair priced transaction is an automatic 15 second delay that they don't deserve. Even F2pool appears to be better behaved than Dwarfpool: although they mine similar proportion of empty blocks, the empty blocks of F2pool are in proportion to their 40 gwei minimum price (and thus theirs is a predictable, market-based behavior).  Dwarfpool on the other hand appears to have a policy that does not follow obvious market forces and its not clear how to get it to change. But enough criticism of Dwarfpool...</p>

          <p> <span class="blog_bold">3) There is one fundamental change that would have a dramatic improvement in confirmation time:  get transactions included in the next block after being posted to the mempool. </span></p><p>Currently, the median confirmation time in blocks from posting to mempool to confirmation on the ETH network is rock steady at 2-3 blocks.   Obviously, a lot of transactions are delayed for reasons such as low gas price but what is surprising is how few transactions are mined after a one block delay (e.g. tx is posted to mempool at block 3,000,000 and mined at block 3,000,001).  It does happen - in fact about 1% of transactions are included in the next block after posting (although the number is so low, it may be an artefact in the database due to propagation delay of these transactions).  The question is why is this percentage so low and does it always have to be this low?  Its not because the blocks are full.  Maybe I’m completely off here- but if there is a client optimization that can be made so that a transaction broadcast to the network meeting all of a miner’s acceptance criteria can be included in the next block, it would have a huge impact on the user experience- cutting median wait times almost in half - a huge gain for users. This would be a bigger advance than reducing block times to 10s.  Hopefully, the brilliant devs will figure this out one day.  Until then, be patient.</p>
